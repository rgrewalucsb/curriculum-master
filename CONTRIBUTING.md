# Contributing to a/A Curriculum

The pride of App Academy is our curriculum. If you see any problems or would like to see anything added please let us know. To stay organized we have a small workflow we would like any contributors to follow.

## Two ways to contribute

### Raise an issue.
If you see a bug, poorly worded material or a broken link. Let us know [here][issues].

### Make a [PR][pulls].

If you are feeling adventurous, make the change yourself.
* Review current [issues][issues] and [PRs][pulls] to prevent duplication
* Follow the [a/A Style Guide][style-guide]
* Make commits and PR names descriptive

## Thanks for contributing!
