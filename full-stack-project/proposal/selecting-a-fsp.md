# Selecting a Full-stack Project

We all have to start somewhere, right? It will be a rare case that you have any experience building a full-stack application, so how to judge which among so many options would make a suitable full-stack project?

There is no end-all answer to this, but here are some things to consider:

### Difficulty

How difficult will cloning *app xyz* be? Think of your skill level and the steps it will take to complete the project. What would your likely pain-points be and are they surmountable in a fixed period of time? Will it also be challenging enough to be a point of pride after completion?

### Related technologies and libraries

We have worked with a very fixed set of libraries and technologies thus far. If there is something you've been dying to dig into or use, your full-stack project could be a great opportunity to do so. You may want to select an app that will allow you to do so.

On the other hand, maybe you really want to clone *app xyz*, but it does this really magical thing that you (as of now) have no idea how to implement. What libraries might be helpful? Do they seem easy to work with (good documentation, lots of users)?

Using third-party libraries can be a boon, but it is important to consider how long it will take to learn/implement said technology. Remember: you only have 10 days, so spending 1 or 2 days struggling with a library is not how we want to be spending our time.

### Interest

There will be many ups and downs while working on your full-stack project. Does the app you want to clone excite you? Do you know it and use it regularly?

### Showcase-ability

If you are interested in mostly frontend work, you may want to choose an app with a lot of views and fancy CSS. If you'd prefer to focus on the backend, consider an app with a lot of querying or complex associations.
