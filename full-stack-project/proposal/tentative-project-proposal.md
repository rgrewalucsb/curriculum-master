# Tentative Project Proposal

Before we ask you to pour your heart and soul into crafting a polished,
thorough blueprint for your full-stack project, we want to be doubly sure
that your core idea is strong enough not only to stand on its own, but
to really impress employers. We also want to encourage some variety among
full-stack projects; this helps distinguish graduates from each other and
is good for the class as a whole.

To facilitate this, we're going to have you submit to us your top three
project choices. You'll do this through a Google form we send to your
email. Your choices for clones are available in this [approved list][clone-link].
At most, one of your choices can be a project of your own design; in this case,
select "Other" and write a brief outline in the provided text field (details
below). Slight modifications to a website are not considered your own design.
It will be considered your own design if either there is no current precedent
for that content or the site you want to clone is not on the approved list.

For projects from the approved list, please also see the [MVP List][mvp-list]
document for required features.

**NB** We highly encourage you to save your own brilliant website idea until
after the Flex project. Full stack and Flex are huge learning experiences and
you will make many mistakes along the way. And you probably don't want your
awesome implementation littered with learning experiences. Also, not having a
website to copy adds a _lot_ of extra planning and design. Keep these things
in mind. 

## Project Outline

This is only required if you're proposing a project not on the approved list,
but it's a good exercise even if you're planning a straight, no-frills clone.
You should write a bulleted list of the features you will need to implement for
your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Your MVP list should contain **four key
features** for your app. Any additional features should be marked `bonus`.
To see some examples from the approved list, please see the [MVP List][mvp-list]
document.

Think carefully about this, but don't spend more than 30 minutes actually
writing the outline. The idea is not to sit down and plan everything out in
minute detail. That will come in the next part of the project. Instead,
consider this a sales pitch. Give us enough detail to show that the project has
merit and that you have a game plan for making it happen.

### Example

#### Project: Twitter Clone

**Summary:** Twitter is a social media app that allows users to
publicly share short 'chirps' (tweets) of text.

**Key Feature Set:**

0. Users can create, view, and edit chirps that are viewable by any other user
0. Users have a private dashboard of other user's chirps and a public profile view of their own chirps
0. Users can follow other users to filter the chirps on their dashboard
0. Users can search for other users
0. Bonus: hashtag incorporation in text and rechirps (retweets)
