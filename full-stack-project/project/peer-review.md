# Peer Review

Today you will get feedback from your classmates.
You will divide into pairs and evaluate one another's apps.
You do need to do a little work ahead of time to prepare for this.

## Ahead of time

During job search portion of the curriculum, you will organize your
search materials using Google Drive.

You are going to create a new folder to house all of your job search
materials. This is where we will provide comments and feedback on them.

You will use this new folder for the first time at the Full Stack
Projects peer review workshop. At the workshop, you and your peers will
review one another's projects, and provide feedback.

Please prepare by working through the following instructions.

1. Create a new Google Drive folder titled "Job search - [your
name]".
2. Change the folder's permissions - set them to "can edit"
for: career-coaches@appacademy.io   (find these options under [Folder
Name] > Share...)
3. Copy [this document][peer-review-spreadsheet] into your new folder.
This spreadsheet lists features that we will look for in your full-stack
projects, to help get the attention of employers.   
4. Make a second copy of the doc. You will have two peer reviewers in
the workshop, and they will each need a copy. You will share these
scoresheets with them to get feedback.

## Day of

You will be assigned two different fellow students to pair with.
You will meet with each pair for 30 minutes. Use the following 
framework for each pairing:
  * Share the spreadsheet you copied in the previous section with your
reviewer.
  * First 15 min: review each other site's and fill out the spreadsheet.
  * Second 15 min: discuss with each other the experience using each
site and provide constructive feedback. Provide explanations for the
scores you gave.
