# Full-Stack Curriculum

## Tentative Project Proposal

Before you can start working on your full-stack project you need to pick
an app to build. You will start by submitting a list of three possible
apps you would be interested in creating. This is your _tentative
proposal_. You will be assigned one of them. Important deadline for the tentative
proposal:


  * **W7D2**: Submit your tentative proposal by 9am
    * [Tentative proposal guidelines][tentative-proposal]
    * [List of approved apps][good-projects]

[tentative-proposal]: proposal/tentative-project-proposal.md
[good-projects]: proposal/projects-to-clone.md

## Design Documents

Before you start on your full-stack project you will create a set of detailed
documents, in which you carefully plan out the app you are going to build.
These are your _full-stack design documents_. Important deadline for the
design documents:

  * **W7D3**: Design Docs Prep: [Component Hierarchy Homework][component]
  * **W7D4**: Design Docs Prep: [State Shape Homework][state-shape]
  * **W7D5**: Design Docs Prep: [Routes Homework][routes]
  * **W8D1**: Submit your full-stack design docs by 9am
    * [Full-stack design document instructions][fsp]
    * [MVP Checklist][mvp-checklist]
    * [Sample Design Docs][sample-design-docs]

full-stack project Here are the important deadlines. Read the rest of this
document and the [workflow you should be following][during-project] before
starting.

* **W9D1**: [Culture Readings](#w9d1)
* **W9D2**: [Peer Review][peer-review]
* **W9D5**: Turn in Full Stack Project
  * [Production README instructions][production-readme]

**NB** You are **not** permitted to use CSS frameworks, like Bootstrap or
Material. Learning true CSS now will allow you to easily pick up CSS frameworks
later. CSS frameworks are a unique skill in themselves and will take just as
long to learn as normal CSS.
