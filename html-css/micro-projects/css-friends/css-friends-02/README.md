We're adding notifications! Add an inline badge, inside the
notifications `<a>` tag. Give it the reusable `.badge` class and style
it round as a circle. You'll want to tweak the padding to get it just
right.

For the dropdown, start by nesting a new list of notification list
elements inside of the original notification list element. Add it right
below the `<a>` tag. You'll see how it stretches the whole header bar
down. It sort of looks right, if only we could lift it out of the
document flow, and have it not stretch its parent. Aha, you say!
Positioning! Remember to create a coordinate system you control, by
setting its parent to `relative` position.

The trick to hiding and showing the dropdown is combining the `:hover`
selector and the display property. How would you select the dropdown
when someone hovers over the parent notification list item?

If you'd like a hint at this point, check out this amazing [cat with
glasses][t-glasses-demo] demo.

To keep the notification text on one line you may use the `white-space`
property.

As you add borders to everything, make sure to nudge the dropdown to
line up nicely with vertical lines in the navigation bar. Finally, you
may have issues with a list item poking through the bottom rounded
edges. Fix this using the `overflow` property.

Before moving on to Phase 3, add a `z-index` of `1` to the whole header
bar. In order to do this, you will also have to set the `position`
property to `relative`, as `z-index` does not work on static,
non-positioned, elements. This should not change anything visually
as-is, but will ensure that our header dropdown will stay on top as we
move on and add more to the page.

Pat yourself on the back, you've earned it! By now we've covered the
core concepts of CSS. Things will just get easier and *way* more fun!

Show off your dropdown to a **TA**.
