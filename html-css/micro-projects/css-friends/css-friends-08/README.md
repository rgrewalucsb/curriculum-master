A grid of friends! Use a list and float every `<li>`! Spacing them
out properly will be tricky. You will need to use `:nth-child()`
pseudo-selectors to add some left and right margin to the middle of
every three `<li>`s.

Create a `.thumb` class to style the links that contain the thumbnails.
You can use the same `../docs/images/cat.jpg` picture for the `<img>` tag.
We will want to reuse this `.thumb` class later. Note that we're not
using this `.thumb` class to float or space the grid, that task is left
to the `<li>`s.

Add `title` attributes containing friend names to the link tags. You
should have something like:
`<a href="#" class="thumb" title="Jonathan">`. Then use `:before`
pseudo-content to grab this title and inject it into the link. Style
this to make it a tool tip, making it a `block` element and position it
absolute.

To position an `absolute` element in the center relative to its parent,
use a combination of `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`. The
`left` percentage is relative to its parent, and will set the current
element's left most pixel to half its parent width. Since this is too
far to the left, we have to adjust this by subtracting half our own
width. The `translateX()` value takes a percentage relative to itself,
which is exactly what we need.

To create a little triangle below the tooltip, we'll need to inject more
pseudo-content. Fortunately, we have two injection points, `:before` and
`:after`. Since we used `:before`, we will now use `:after`. Look at
[this demo][t-triangles] how you can make a triangle out of borders.

If you'd like an additional hint, check out this [tool tip][t-tooltip]
demo. But give it a shot yourself first!
