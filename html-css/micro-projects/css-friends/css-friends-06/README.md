Divide the sidebar up into three sections: `.profile-picture`,
`.profile-info`, and `.profile-nav`.

Have the `.profile-picture` be a link that contains an image tag with
the provided `./images/cat.jpg` picture. Make the link a `block`
element and style it. Thanks to your earlier reset, the image will now
expand to fill the full width of the link.

To pull the `.profile-picture` partly out of its sidebar section, use a
negative `margin-top`. This is better than positioning, as it is still
in the document flow, and won't leave a gap, but pull everything up with
it.

To make sure it is in front of the `.content-header` section, you will
have to position it `relative`. You do not need to nudge it (we used
`margin-top` to do that) or give it a z-index. As they're now both
`relative`, order of appearance on the page dictates the stacking order.
This is in our favor, as `.profile-picture` is declared later.

To get the divider lines between all the `.profile-nav` list elements,
but also at the top and bottom, you'll want to use a pseudo selector
like `:first-child`, `:last-child`, or `:nth-child()`.
