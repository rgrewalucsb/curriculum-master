Let's study the first *real* set of screenshots and make a plan of
attack.

Typography is always the best place to start. Pull up the specs. The
first thing you'll notice is a font family that most computers do not
have installed. Fortunately, Google provides it to us for free as a
hosted webfont. Find it on [Google Fonts][t-google-fonts], select the
appropriate font-weights, and include the provided `<link>` tag right
before the other `<link>` tags in the `<head>`.

In `./css/01-header.css` set the default font weight, family and size on
the `body` tag. If you set up your reset correctly, these styles will
nicely trickle down to all child elements going forward.

The next step is to analyze the screenshots. You want to start thinking
of everything as being contained in boxes. We see an outer red box that
expands to the full width, with inside it a fixed width box. On the left
you see the "App Academy Friends" logo heading, and on the right a list
of links. How would you express these meanings using semantic tags?

Let's look at [this list][tags] of tags. I'd suggest using the
`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<h1>`, `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to express our
structure. Go ahead and write the skeleton in HTML.

Now add text and links. As you'll be adding dummy links throughout this
project, I recommend using a pound sign as the href: `<a href="#">`.
That will prevent a page reload.

Now that we have some structured markup in place, let's add some nice
classes as hooks to select. Start by adding an outer `.header` class,
for the full bar. Then add a `.header-nav` class for the fixed width
container inside. I'd also suggest using a `.header-logo` and
`.header-list` class on the `<h1>` and `<ul>` elements, as this will
keep our selectors nice and shallow. I'd avoid adding classes to the
individual `<li>`s, as we can select them by their parent.

With these classes in your HTML, jump to the `./css/01-header.css` file
and make an outline of all the classes you added as selectors. Now go
fill them out with actual styles. Make small changes, immediately
refreshing in your browser to see the changes. Your understanding will
grow by experimenting!

To center a smaller block element inside a larger block element, you'll
want to set its left and right margins to `auto`. Since block elements
cannot sit next to each other normally, you're going to need to use `flex`.
It's OK to flex things inside of flexed things.

You'll want to justify your logo `<h1>` to the left, and the `<ul>` list
of links to the right. To get the individual `<li>` next to each other
you'll want to again use `flex`.

It can be helpful to give elements a temporary background color, to see
their appearance while debugging.

As you put paddings in place, remember that usability is important. We
want large click targets. Make your links `block` elements and add
padding to them. Also do not forget the hover states, this is important
and gratifying feedback for the user.

Pixel perfect? Do not move on before calling over a **TA** to check your
work!
