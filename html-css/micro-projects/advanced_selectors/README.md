[skeleton]: ./skeleton.zip

1. Set the `cursor:pointer` and `outline:none` properties for all radio buttons, select elements, and submit buttons.
2. Style the `background-color` of the submit button gold using the `last-child` selector and give it a darkening hover effect.
3. Color every other list element in the directions list with a light-grey background.
4. Use the `+` operator to select the first review immediately after the Reviews header element and give it a 1px, solid, black, top border (Hint: the class for a submitted review will be `.user_review`).
5. Style the radio buttons with stars! Use the `stars.png` file in the assets folder. You will need to use the [WebKit extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions) property `-webkit-appearance: none;`.
